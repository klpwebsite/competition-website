  	<p>Take a trip up to The Shard! This 95-storey beast lies in the heart of Southwark and is the ideal spot to celebrate a special moment with your special someone. Soak in the surreal view of London whilst dining at a selection of restaurants (our personal favourite is Duck and Waffle - it’s open 24/7!). The Shard is located within a few minutes’ walk from London Bridge Underground Station (Northern and Jubilee lines) and London Bridge Station (Southern and South Eastern trains) – you can’t miss it. Don’t forget to grab your dancing shoes as every Saturday night 10PM TimeOut throws a silent disco on the top floor!</p>

  <div class="date-description" id="Circus">
  	<h2>Circus</h2>
  	<img src="http://blog.grosvenorcasinos.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Circus.jpg" />
  	<p>Circus is a beautiful collision of cabaret restaurant and cocktail bar nestling in the heart of London’s vibrant Covent Garden. Join them for a night of exquisite entertainment whilst dining their highly popular Pan-Asian menu, created and overseen by Executive Chef Andrew Lassetter. <br/> The stylish surrealist interior transports guests into a decadent world of glamour and escapism from the moment they enter, with the highlight; a striking quartz 'Stage' table seating up to 28 guests dominating the room. As evening descends, the restaurant comes to life and the spectacle begins as diners sip exotic punches and cocktails whilst beautifully skilled performers twirl magically in suspended hoops and wow the crowd. The adventures continue after dinner as the music is turned up and the dancing begins.</p>

  	<img src="http://onthethames.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bateaux-afternoon-tea-buyagift.jpg" />
  	<p>Why not see the best views in London while you tuck into tea, scones and all the trimmings of a traditional afternoon tea on the Thames? Afternoon Tea while cruising along the Thames. What a civilised way to pass the afternoon. And if the mood takes you, perhaps a glass of something bubbly? </p>

  	<p>Hyde Park is the perfect place for a picnic, and a haven of tranquillity right in the heart of London. Its relaxing atmosphere makes it an ideal location for first dates, and you won't be short of things to do; take an open water swim in the Serpentine (not for the faint hearted!) or a visit to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial fountain. It's easily accessible by tube, the nearest stations being Hyde Park Corner, Marble Arch and Lancaster Gate. On November 17th Hyde Park will be transformed into the annual Winter Wonderland; you can even book your tickets now for a truly magical date!</p>
